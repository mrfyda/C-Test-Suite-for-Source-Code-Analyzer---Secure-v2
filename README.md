# C-Test-Suite-for-Source-Code-Analyzer---Secure-v2

This test suite replaces test suite 46 based on a collaboration with Alexander Hoole from University of Victoria, BC, Canada. The new test cases provided by these test suites contain the following improvements: removal of targeted weaknesses from 13 "GOOD" test cases in test suite 46, removal of extraneous weaknesses, replacement of test cases to align with the CWEs specified in NIST SP 500-268 v1.1, creation of additional test cases to provide consistent BAD/GOOD pairings, application of minor improvements to code, renaming of files and the addition of FLAW/FIX comments to assist automation, and insertion of improved metadata to assist researchers using SARD. Please refer to the test case metadata fields to view additional information for each test case. Note: Some test cases have been deprecated and replaced with fixed versions since this test suite has been initially published.
